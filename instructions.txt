GUIDELINES:
1.WORKING WITH GIT
*Always make small commits with proper commit messages
*Always create a new branch whenever you want to try out a new feature.Then merge this new branch with old one once you're satisfied.
*Try to keep the master branch clean,both locally and on the remote.MASTER branch should only consist of clean-working code
few important comands:
git add -A : to add all edited files to staging area

git status : to see the status of your repo(commited/uncommitted changes)

git log : to see the previous versions with commit msgs

git branch <branch_name> : creates a new branch

git checkout <branch_name> : switch to other branch

git commit -m: commit all the staged files and open an editor to enter commit msg,press 'Esc' and type ":wq",hit enter to save and commit

git checkout <revision_number> : to switch to a previous version(just to see what it looked like)

git merge -r <branch> : merge the "branch" with the current branch

2.Setting up DATABASE
*Open phpmyadmin,click on mb_db2 database(create one if it doesn't exist)
*Make sure you have a user named "mentorbuddy" host="localhost" with password "mentorbuddy" with all privileges granted(phpmyadmin->users) 
*Delete any previous saved version of mb_db2(click mb_db2->operations tab->select 'drop the database')
*Now open cmd prompt or git bash from project folder and enter "python manage.py syncdb --all"
*Now go to phpmyadmin->mb_db2->IMPORT tab
*Select the sql file in the project folder and click on "Go"
*You're done setting up :)

3.Setting up Social Apps
*When you have imported the sql file included in the project folder,you have basically imported socialapps table consisting of various different Social Apps,their API keys & IDs needed to connect to them.
*Go to localhost:8000/admin after starting localserver
*go to "Sites"
*Change the example.com to Mentorbuddy.in
*Now go to Social Apps
*Go to facebook and linkedin and add MentorBuddy.in to sites
